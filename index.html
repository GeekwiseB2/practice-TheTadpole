        <h3>I started taking Bitwise classes because I was adrift looking for something to do while I studied for my psychology degree. My friend Sean who works in Shift3 told me about the classes and I decided to give them a shot. I still am pursuing my degree in psychology and I enjoy coding so I am looking to combine the two by developing an app or a website that coincides with eachother.</h3>
